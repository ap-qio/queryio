<h2 id="intro"><span>How to access data</span></h2>
<p>Data Browser is a file explorer. It allows you to access all the directories and files stored in QueryIO.</p>

<p>Files and folders displayed are retrieved from all the DataNodes in the cluster. By default, data browser shows all the files and directories in root directory i.e "/" and allows you 
to access files or navigate through the directories.</p>
<p>Using Data Browser, you can also <b>download</b> files from HDFS to your local file system.</p>
