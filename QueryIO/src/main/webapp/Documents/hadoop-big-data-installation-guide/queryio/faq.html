<h3 id="1">Q: Installer is not working fine. I am getting ELF bad interpreter error on trying to install it on Linux.</h3>

<p>You need to install "ld-linux.so.2". You can install it using following command:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> yum install ld-linux.so.2</li>
	</ul>
<hr>
<br>

<h3 id="2">Q: Does QueryIO support windows platform?</h3>
<p>No, QueryIO does not support windows platform.</p>
<!-- <p>Only QueryIO UI server is supported on windows platform, but not Hadoop cluster. You'll need a linux or mac machine for Hadoop cluster.</p>   -->
<hr>
<br>

<h3 id="3">Q: Does QueryIO require Administrative privileges for Installation?</h3>
<p>No, you don't need administrative privileges for installation. But you must have access to destination location where software is installed.</p>
<hr>
<br>

<h3 id="4">Q: On completion of installation the QueryUI server is not starting. What should I do?</h3>
<p>Try starting the QueryIO server manually. Goto $INSTALL_HOME/tomcat/bin and run following executable file:</p>
<ul>
	<!-- <li>For Windows:	start_queryio.bat</li> -->
	<li>For Linux/Mac OS: 	./start_queryio.sh</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<br>

<h3 id="5">Q: In remote installation setup, installer is unable to SSH to remote machine. What should I do?</h3>
<p>Please check that SSH service is enabled on remote machine and credentials provided are correct.</p>
<hr>
<br>

<h3 id="6">Q: What is "First time user registration"?</h3>
<p>This screen appears when you visit QueryIO UI for the first time. Server needs atleast one admin user. </p>
<hr><br>    
     
<h3 id="7">Q: After running the server successfully, QueryIO UI is not properly displayed in my browser.</h3>
<p>The reason might be outdated version of your browser. Please update your browser. See <a href="hadoop-requirements.html">System Requirements</a> for more details.</p>
