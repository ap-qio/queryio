<h1><span>Introduction</span></h1>
<p class="whs5">QueryIO is a Hadoop-based big data query and analytics solution. QueryIO enables users to manage and analyze their Big Data. 
QueryIO offers a comprehensive software solutions for cloud data storage and computing.</p>

<h2><span>Features of QueryIO</span></h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>QueryIO Server UI</b>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Hadoop - Distributed Storage and Computing</b>
		<br>QueryIO is built on the Hadoop distributed computing platform. 
			Hadoop is a robust and scalable platform used by major companies such as Yahoo, Facebook and eBay. 
			Hadoop uses clusters of commodity Compute+Storage machines to provide virtually linear scalability.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Data Tagging and MetaData Extension services</b>
		<br>QueryIO provides a framework to build a structure around unstructured Big Data.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Standard SQL-based Big Data querying, analysis and visualization</b>
		<br>Once the structure is assembled, you can query your Big Data using standard SQL syntax and tools. Leverage tools and skills your organization already has to query, analyze and visualize your Big Data.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Cluster Setup and Management</b>
		<br>Manage your Hadoop cluster via a Web-based interface. Define hosts, services, perform maintenance, etc. with click of few buttons. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>HA, Monitoring, Tuning</b>
		<br>Experience peace of mind and confidence with our comprehensive monitoring at every level (disk, machine, services, JVM, etc).
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Drive MapReduce jobs via Hive SQL (HiveQL)</b>
		<br>Hive is a data warehouse system for Hadoop that facilitates easy data summarization, ad-hoc queries, and the analysis of large datasets stored in Hadoop compatible file systems. 
			Hive provides a mechanism to project structure onto this data and query the data using a SQL-like language called HiveQL. 
			At the same time this language also allows traditional map/reduce programmers to plug in their custom mappers and reducers when it is inconvenient or inefficient to express this logic in HiveQL.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Data Integration services</b>
		<br>Import/export data from Amazon S3, HDFS, SFTP source, any mail server, SSH, any type of database, HTTP/HTTPS, any FTP source or from your local file system. 
			Leverage our value-added services such as data encryption and compression on per file or system-wide basis. 
			Use user-based authentication or Kerberos based authentication.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Client interfaces</b>
		<br>QueryIO provides a comprehensive set of client interface to integrate seamlessly with your infrastructure. 
			Use our S3-compatible REST API to port your application from S3 to your QueryIO storage. Or use standard REST API to integrate with QueryIO.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Data Analytics - Spreadsheets, Charts, Grouping, Aggregations, UDFs, Formatting</b>
	</li>
</ul>
