<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>What is QueryIO</b></p>
<p>
QueryIO is a solution for Big Data Analytics. QueryIO is used to store and process vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. 
QueryIO is especially well suited to enable users to process unstructured data, give it a structure and support analysis of this data using standard SQL. 
QueryIO enables you to leverage the vast and mature infrastructure built around SQL and relational databases and utilize it for your Big Data Analytics needs. 
</p>
<p>
QueryIO builds on Hadoop's scalability and reliability. QueryIO makes it easy to scale to hundreds of Compute+Store cluster nodes and peta bytes of data in an easy and logical manner. 
QueryIO enhances basic Hadoop to provide a comprehensive Big Data Analytics solution. Some key enhancements QueryIO provides to basic Hadoop:

<li>
Data Tagging and MetaData extension 
</li>
<li>
Standard SQL interface for hadoop big data querying and analysis 
</li>
<li>
Web-based cluster management
</li>
<li>
Comprehensive monitoring, including rules, alerts, etc. 
</li>
<li>
Value added services such as S3-compatible REST API, FTP interface, etc.  
</li>

		<li> Data Tagging feature which provides users an extensive Data Intelligence framework enabling users to create data tags in MetaStore DB for files on HDFS cluster. Both On-Ingest and Post-Ingest processing is supported.</li> 
		<li> Enhanced Hive to support recursive processing of folders / files.</li>
		<li> Enhanced Hive to understand file path filter patterns, restricting the processing of files to just user defined file path pattern.</li>
		<li> Support to extract FilePath as well during Hive Queries.</li>
		<li> Support for Input Path Filter while executing Hive Queries. This has an advantage where you can use Hive to process just subset of files based on query results from MetaStore.</li>
		<li> Support for MySQL database along with PostgreSQL out of the box.</li>
		<li> Implemented Generic framework to enable user to configure other databases to use with QueryIO.</li>
		<li> Separation of result set from Report Viewer, enabling analysis of same query results with Spreadsheet and other report formats like html, pdf and xls.</li>
		<li> Support for cluster setup during installation and fixing other know issues with the installer.</li>
		<li> Support for local cluster installation for evaluation users. Local cluster installation now supports 127.0.0.1/localhost which allows the cluster to work fine even when the IP address of the installation machine changes. This makes evaluation process easier for users connecting to networks allocating dynamic IP addresses, or for users connecting to different networks at home and office.</li>
		<li> Support for upgrading from one version of QueryIO to another. This enables user to persist all his data on cluster / user reports / queries / cluster configurations etc. created in older installation.</li>
